        <p>Microorganisms in food multiply very quickly, especially at room temperature. Studies have shown that food that has been heated to over + 70 ° C can generally be classified as safe.</p>
        <p>Therefore:
          <ul>
             <li>Thoroughly heat meat, poultry and seafood as well as soups and stews; at least 10 minutes at + 70 ° C</li>
            <li>Stir the food when heating it in the microwave to ensure that it is heated evenly</li>
            <li>Fry or cook meat and fish dishes completely. All parts must reach a temperature of at least + 70 ° C</li>
            <li>use a roasting thermometer to be on the safe side</li>
           <li>Cook fresh fish until it is opaque and easy to cut into layers with a fork</li>
        </ul>

<p>Standard advice is to cook food until it has reached a core temperature of 70°C for 2 minutes. The other time and temperature combinations are:
  <ul>
    <li>60°C for 45 minutes</li>
  <li>65°C for 10 minutes</li>
  <li>70°C for 2 minutes</li>
  <li>75°C for 30 seconds</li>
 <li> 80°C for 6 seconds</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>Cooking food at the right temperature and for the correct length of time will ensure that any harmful bacteria are killed.</p>
<p>You can check the temperature of a food using a clean probe. Insert the probe so that the tip is in the centre of the food or the thickest part.</p>

  </p>
<h3>Regularly wash and disinfect your hands thoroughly</h3>
<p>Our hands come into contact with pathogens practically everywhere. Thorough hand washing using soap and hot water followed by drying using disposable towels prevents these pathogens from being transferred to food. Always wash your hands in the designated washbasins and never in sinks in which food or crockery and cutlery are cleaned. Wash your hands thoroughly before starting work, after every break and regularly between individual work stages. After washing your hands, you should also disinfect them, at least after handling raw foods, in particular meat, poultry and eggs as well as after using the toilet. Observe the in-house instructions on staff hygiene.</p>
<h3>Do not cough or sneeze on food</h3>
<p>Even healthy people have bacteria in their nose and throat that can result in food poisoning. To ensure that these bacteria and any viruses they contain are not transferred to food via tiny droplets, always turn away from food if you have to cough or sneeze. Cough in your elbow and use a paper tissue to clean your noise. Then throw the tissue away, thoroughly wash your hands and disinfect them.</p>
<h3>Cover open wounds using waterproof dressings</h3>
<p>Under no circumstances must open wounds come into contact with food, as these wounds may contain food-poisoning bacteria. Wounds must therefore be covered with a water-tight plaster, a clean bandage and a rubber finger cot or a rubber glove. It is advisable to use coloured material where possible, as this will make it easier to recognise if it becomes detached from the wound.</p>

  </p>
<p>Only a small number of factors related to food handling are responsible for a large proportion of foodborne disease episodes everywhere. Common errors include:
	<ul>
    <li>preparation of food several hours prior to consumption, combined with its storage at temperatures which favour growth of pathogenic bacteria and/or formation of toxins</li>
	 <li>insufficient cooking or reheating of food to reduce or eliminate pathogens</li>
	 <li>cross contamination</li>
	<li>people with poor personal hygiene handling the food</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In order to avoid the transmission of germs from one food to the other, certain goods should be stored and prepared separately from one another. The shelf life can also be positively influenced by separating certain products.
Therefore:
	<ul> 
    <li>Use different boards and knives for cutting meat and vegetables</li>
	 <li>Store raw meat, poultry and seafood separately from other foods - Avoid contact between cooked and raw foods</li>
	 <li>Do not put ready-to-eat food in containers or crockery in which raw food such as meat, fish and eggs were previously stored</li>
	 <li>Always wash fruits, salads and vegetables with drinking water. Repeated washing is better than washing with plenty of water once</li>
	 <li>Do not leave fruits and vegetables wet after washing</li>
	 <li>Peeling can effectively reduce contamination. Throw away anything moldy or rotten</li>

  <h2 id="food-purchasing">Purchasing</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="../docs/preboarding/HomeMeal_Purchasing.pdf"
      >download Purchasing pdf</a
    >
  </p>
<p>Purchasing is the very first step of a process that takes place in the kitchen every day. If you are purchasing your supplies in person you must take the utmost care to ensure the quality of the ingredients. Should you order food and supplies they must be thoroughly inspected upon delivery to ensure safety. Food can be saved from spoiling and contamination by proper storage.</p>
<p>Purchase food and its ingredients from reliable and approved sources. Do not buy from questionable sources:
	<ul>
    <li>Stay connected with suppliers and, if necessary, request for relevant supporting documents, including business licences, official export documents and health certificates, certificates of origin, laboratory reports, etc.</li>
	 <li>Ascertain that suppliers have obtained the required valid licenses.</li>
	 <li>Keep a list of suppliers names and contact details. Update suppliers' information timely fashion.</li>
	<li>Provide full copies of supporting documents such as business registration, health certificates, and any other system certification documents (if necessary).</li>
	 <li>Keep all purchasing and sales records, receipts, food origin and hygiene-related documents to facilitate food tracing in the event of a food incident.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
Upon receipt of food, the following items should be inspected:
<ul>
	 <li>Fruits and vegetables are undamaged and free of bruises. No cracked or leaky eggs and 	no moldy dried foods should be received.</li>
	 <li>All prepackaged foods have an expiry date, such as "use by" or "best before" dates.</li>
	 <li>The outer packaging should be intact with no tears. Canned foods are not bulging, dented or rusty. The packaging materials are clean and undamaged.</li>
	 <li>Store chilled food at 4°C or below, and frozen food at -18°C or below.</li>
	 <li>Each batch of seafood (including oysters) must be attached with a valid health certificate.</li>
	- <li>If it is found or suspected that the food is unsafe, has been stored at an improper temperature for an extended period of time, has been contaminated or damaged, or is required to be recalled, it must be immediately returned to the suppliers and separated from normal items during temporary storage.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In short, remember:
	<ul>
     <li>Ensure that goods are in perfect condition and not damaged</li>
	 <li>Do not interrupt the cold chain</li>
	 <li>Transport perishable food maintaining a cold chain</li>
	 <li>Buy freshly perishable goods</li>
	<li> Store newly purchased supplies at home in such a way that the older groceries are used  first</li>

  <p>
    <a href="../docs/preboarding/HomeMeal_Storage.pdf"

  </p>
<p>Correct storage can have a positive effect on the life of food. Therefore:
 <ul>
   <li>Immediately store food in the right place in the household immediately after shopping</li>
	 <li>Store perishable food according to the temperature information on the packaging</li>
	<li>Do not store prepared food for longer than two hours at room temperature as the bacterias start growing.</li>
	<li>Immediately cool cooked and perishable foods below + 7 ° C</li>
	 <li>Cooked food that should be kept warm until consumption (e.g. rice or stew) should be stored at + 65 ° C - + 75 ° C and consumed no later than 3 hours after preparation</li>
	<li>Always store food in closed containers or e.g. cover with foil</li>
	 <li>Always observe the best-before or use-by date</li>
<li>Food poisoning is frequently caused by bacteria from foods that have been incorrectly stored, prepared, handled or cooked. Food contaminated with food poisoning bacteria may look, smell and taste normal. If food is not stored properly, the bacteria in it can multiply to dangerous levels.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Beware of the temperature danger zone</h3>
<p>Food poisoning bacteria grow and multiply fastest in the temperature danger zone between 5 °C and 60 °C. It is important to keep high-risk food out of this temperature zone.</p>
<h3>Take special care with high-risk foods</h3>
<p>Food poisoning bacteria can grow and multiply on some types of food more easily than others. High-risk foods include:
<ul>
   <li>raw and cooked meat - such as chicken and minced meat, and foods containing them, such as casseroles, curries and lasagne</li>
	<li>dairy products - such as custard and dairy-based desserts like custard tarts and cheesecake</li>
	<li>eggs and egg products - such as mousse</li>
	 <li>small goods - such as ham and salami</li>
	 <li>seafood - such as seafood salad, patties, fish balls, stews containing seafood and fish stock</li>
	 <li>cooked rice and pasta</li>
	 <li>prepared salads - such as coleslaws, pasta salads and rice salads</li>
	 <li>prepared fruit salads</li>
	<li>ready-to-eat foods - such as sandwiches, rolls, and pizzas that contain any of the food above</li>
</ul>
Food that comes in packages, cans and jars can become high-risk foods once opened, and should be handled and stored correctly.</p>
<h3>Storing food in the fridge</h3>
<p>Your fridge temperature should be at 5 °C or below. The freezer temperature should be below -15 °C. Use a thermometer to check the temperature in your fridge.</p>
<h3>Freezing food safely</h3>
<p>When shopping, buy chilled and frozen foods at the end of your trip and take them home to store as quickly as possible. On hot days or for trips longer than 30 minutes, try to take an insulated cooler bag or ice pack to keep frozen foods cold. Keep hot and cold foods separate while you take them home.</p>
<p>When you arrive home, put chilled and frozen foods into the fridge or freezer immediately. Make sure foods stored in the freezer are frozen hard.</p>
<h3>Storing cooked food safely</h3>
<p>When you have cooked food and want to cool it:
<ul>
   <li>Put hot food into shallow dishes or separate into smaller portions to help cool the food as quickly as possible.</li>
	 <li>Don't put very hot food into the refrigerator. Wait until steam has stopped rising from the food before putting it in the fridge.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Avoid refreezing thawed food</h3>
<p>Food poisoning bacteria can grow in frozen food while it is thawing, so avoid thawing frozen food in the temperature danger zone. Keep defrosted food in the fridge until it is ready to be cooked. If using a microwave oven to defrost food, cook it immediately after defrosting.</p>
<p> As a general rule, avoid refreezing thawed food. Food that is frozen a second time is likely to have higher levels of food poisoning bacteria. The risk depends on the condition of the food when frozen, and how the food is handled between thawing and refreezing. Raw food should never be refrozen once thawed.</p>
<h3>Store raw food separately from cooked food<h3>
<p>Raw food and cooked food should be stored separately in the fridge. Bacteria from raw food can contaminate cold cooked food, and the bacteria can multiply to dangerous levels if the food is not cooked thoroughly again </p>
<p>Always store raw food in sealed or covered containers at the bottom of the fridge. Keep raw foods below cooked foods, to avoid liquid such as meat juices dripping down and contaminating the cooked food.</p>
<h3>Choose strong, non-toxic food storage containers<h3>
<p>Make sure your food storage containers are clean and in good condition, and only use them for storing food. Cover them with tight-fitting lids, foil or plastic film to minimise potential contamination. Transfer the contents of opened cans into suitable containers.</p>
<h3>If in doubt, throw it out!</h3>
<p>Throw out high-risk food left in the temperature danger zone for more than 4 hours - don't put it in the fridge and don't keep it for later. Check the use-by dates on food products and discard out-of-date food. If you are uncertain of the use-by date, throw it out.</p>

<p>Bacteria usually multiply faster at higher temperatures. The refrigerator should therefore be set to temperatures of no more than + 7 ° C and the freezer to -18 ° C to -20 ° C. The growth of germs is greatly reduced at refrigerator temperature, but there are also microorganisms that can multiply at these temperatures. </p>
<p> Therefore:
<ul> <li>Put the minced meat in a cool place immediately and process and cook through on the day of manufacture or purchase</li>
	 <li>Fresh fish and fishery products must be stored at temperatures below + 2 ° C</li>
	<li> In order to maintain the viability of mussels and oysters, cooling at + 4 ° C to max. + 10 ° C</li>
	<li>Always defrost meat and poultry in the refrigerator or microwave</li>
	<li>Let the food cool down before putting it in the refrigerator. Portion larger quantities so that the cooling process is not too long.</li>
	 <li>Only prepare meals that contain raw eggs (e.g. tiramisu) with very fresh eggs and then cool and consume immediately</li>
	 <li>Freezing prevents or slows down the growth of microorganisms and thus extends the shelf life of the food. The killing or reducing of germs is usually not associated with deep freezing.</li>
	<li> Don't overfill your fridge. Leaving space allows air to circulate and maintains the set temperature.</li> 
</ul>

          We want you to operate safely and our customer to consume hygienic
          food. Since you run your own business operation at a private kitchen,
          it becomes hard for us to check and control everything from distance
          everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the freedom to cook but you also have the following
          responsibilities to fulfil.
        </p>
        <p>
          For partners, it is important to have the following checklist,
          documents and proofs so when the hygiene inspectors come and inspect
          the kitchen, you can provide them on being requested.
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>
            As our partner, you own a red card (Rote Karte / Erstbelehrung nach
            § 43 & 42 Infektionsschutzgesetz). - Provide us a copy of it.

            well-informed and competent of applying it to daily business. -
            Certificate is not obligatory. If you're a chef, we believe you got
            this knowledge through your studies & working experiences. - (For
            non-chefs): With us is shared how & what they studied in couple of
            sentences long document.
          </li>

            offering food on our platform if you're in an ongoing process of
            registration, but it should be done as soon as possible (and
            completed within 3 months after getting Rote Karte). - Any
            business/freelancing work which is registered and has nothing to do
            with food is not sufficient and you will need to register a new
            business. Form of business will be Einzelunternehmen / Sole
            Proprietorship
          </li>
          <li>

            / freezer temperature; when the kitchen / fridge was cleaned; pests
            control... - You learn about it in LMHV video/links provided from
            us. - Have standard papers to track with data of temperature,
            cleaning, ingredients and allergens. Download from Useful Downloads

            You need to measure & document the temperature of the food at the
            pick-up regularly. It should have more than 65 degrees if hot or be
            below 5 degrees if cold. If handing over cold, we recommend to add a

            made some home-made sauce (e.g. for the next day) must be on the
            label when you made it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use specific products to clean the surfaces, oven, fridge or other
