Wash your hands thoroughly before starting work, after every break and regularly between individual work stages. After washing your hands, you should also disinfect them, at least after handling raw foods, in particular meat, poultry and eggs as well as after using the toilet. Observe the in-house instructions on staff hygiene.</p>\n<h3>Do not cough or sneeze on food</h3>\n<p>Even healthy people have bacteria in their nose and throat that can result in food poisoning. To ensure that these bacteria and any viruses they contain are not transferred to food via tiny droplets, always turn away from food if you have to cough or sneeze. Cough in your elbow and use a paper tissue to clean your noise. Then throw the tissue away, thoroughly wash your hands and disinfect them.</p>\n<h3>Cover open wounds using waterproof dressings</h3>\n<p>Under no circumstances must open wounds come into contact with food, as these wounds may contain food-poisoning bacteria. Wounds must therefore be covered with a water-tight plaster, a clean bandage and a rubber finger cot or a rubber glove. It is advisable to use coloured material where possible, as this will make it easier to recognise if it becomes detached from the wound.</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"/6a8bc8bbb64ad975a596e4e6b9f83c3b.pdf\">download Cleaning and Cleanliness pdf</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"guidelines\">\n  <h2 id=\"processing-food\">Processing food</h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"/83672542a8af1d0ae69f0a07d832050e.pdf\">download Processing Food pdf</a>\n  </p>\n<p>Only a small number of factors related to food handling are responsible for a large proportion of foodborne disease episodes everywhere. Common errors include:\n\t<ul>\n    <li>preparation of food several hours prior to consumption, combined with its storage at temperatures which favour growth of pathogenic bacteria and/or formation of toxins</li>\n\t <li>insufficient cooking or reheating of food to reduce or eliminate pathogens</li>\n\t <li>cross contamination</li>\n\t<li>people with poor personal hygiene handling the food</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>In order to avoid the transmission of germs from one food to the other, certain goods should be stored and prepared separately from one another.

If you are purchasing your supplies in person you must take the utmost care to ensure the quality of the ingredients. Should you order food and supplies they must be thoroughly inspected upon delivery to ensure safety. Food can be saved from spoiling and contamination by proper storage.</p>\n<p>Purchase food and its ingredients from reliable and approved sources. Do not buy from questionable sources:\n\t<ul>\n    <li>Stay connected with suppliers and, if necessary, request for relevant supporting documents, including business licences, official export documents and health certificates, certificates of origin, laboratory reports, etc.</li>\n\t <li>Ascertain that suppliers have obtained the required valid licenses.</li>\n\t <li>Keep a list of suppliers names and contact details. Update suppliers' information timely fashion.</li>\n\t<li>Provide full copies of supporting documents such as business registration, health certificates, and any other system certification documents (if necessary).</li>\n\t <li>Keep all purchasing and sales records, receipts, food origin and hygiene-related documents to facilitate food tracing in the event of a food incident.</li>\n  </ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon receipt of food, the following items should be inspected:\n<ul>\n\t <li>Fruits and vegetables are undamaged and free of bruises. No cracked or leaky eggs and \tno moldy dried foods should be received.</li>\n\t <li>All prepackaged foods have an expiry date, such as \"use by\" or \"best before\" dates.</li>\n\t <li>The outer packaging should be intact with no tears. Canned foods are not bulging, dented or rusty. The packaging materials are clean and undamaged.</li>\n\t <li>Store chilled food at 4°C or below, and frozen food at -18°C or below.</li>\n\t <li>Each batch of seafood (including oysters) must be attached with a valid health certificate.</li>\n\t- <li>If it is found or suspected that the food is unsafe, has been stored at an improper temperature for an extended period of time, has been contaminated or damaged, or is required to be recalled, it must be immediately returned to the suppliers and separated from normal items during temporary storage.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>In short, remember:\n\t<ul>\n     <li>Ensure that goods are in perfect condition and not damaged</li>\n\t <li>Do not interrupt the cold chain</li>\n\t <li>Transport perishable food maintaining a cold chain</li>\n\t <li>Buy freshly perishable goods</li>\n\t<li> Store newly purchased supplies at home in such a way that the older groceries are used  first</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"/349629ea544cce27ef95cc71ba5f8a21.pdf\">download Purchasing pdf</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"guidelines\">\n  <h2 id=\"food-storage\">Storage</h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"/9978e69bb7d5691a146ac55456728b83.pdf\">download Food Storage pdf</a>\n  </p>\n<p>Correct storage can have a positive effect on the life of food. Therefore:\n <ul>\n   <li>Immediately store food in the right place in the household immediately after shopping</li>\n\t <li>Store perishable food according to the temperature information on the packaging</li>\n\t<li>Do not store prepared food for longer than two hours at room temperature as the bacterias start growing.</li>\n\t<li>Immediately cool cooked and perishable foods below + 7 ° C</li>\n\t <li>Cooked food that should be kept warm until consumption (e.g. rice or stew) should be stored at + 65 ° C - + 75 ° C and consumed no later than 3 hours after preparation</li>\n\t<li>Always store food in closed containers or e.g. cover with foil</li>\n\t <li>Always observe the best-before or use-by date</li>\n<li>Food poisoning is frequently caused by bacteria from foods that have been incorrectly stored, prepared, handled or cooked. Food contaminated with food poisoning bacteria may look, smell and taste normal. If food is not stored properly, the bacteria in it can multiply to dangerous levels.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h3>Beware of the temperature danger zone</h3>\n<p>Food poisoning bacteria grow and multiply fastest in the temperature danger zone between 5 °C and 60 °C. It is important to keep high-risk food out of this temperature zone.</p>\n<h3>Take special care with high-risk foods</h3>\n<p>Food poisoning bacteria can grow and multiply on some types of food more easily than others. High-risk foods include:\n<ul>\n   <li>raw and cooked meat - such as chicken and minced meat, and foods containing them, such as casseroles, curries and lasagne</li>\n\t<li>dairy products - such as custard and dairy-based desserts like custard tarts and cheesecake</li>\n\t<li>eggs and egg products - such as mousse</li>\n\t <li>small goods - such as ham and salami</li>\n\t <li>seafood - such as seafood salad, patties, fish balls, stews containing seafood and fish stock</li>\n\t <li>cooked rice and pasta</li>\n\t <li>prepared salads - such as coleslaws, pasta salads and rice salads</li>\n\t <li>prepared fruit salads</li>\n\t<li>ready-to-eat foods - such as sandwiches, rolls, and pizzas that contain any of the food above</li>\n</ul>\nFood that comes in packages, cans and jars can become high-risk foods once opened, and should be handled and stored correctly.</p>\n<h3>Storing food in the fridge</h3>\n<p>Your fridge temperature should be at 5 °C or below. The freezer temperature should be below -15 °C. Use a thermometer to check the temperature in your fridge.</p>\n<h3>Freezing food safely</h3>\n<p>When shopping, buy chilled and frozen foods at the end of your trip and take them home to store as quickly as possible. On hot days or for trips longer than 30 minutes, try to take an insulated cooler bag or ice pack to keep frozen foods cold. Keep hot and cold foods separate while you take them home.</p>\n<p>When you arrive home, put chilled and frozen foods into the fridge or freezer immediately. Make sure foods stored in the freezer are frozen hard.</p>\n<h3>Storing cooked food safely</h3>\n<p>When you have cooked food and want to cool it:\n<ul>\n   <li>Put hot food into shallow dishes or separate into smaller portions to help cool the food as quickly as possible.</li>\n\t <li>Don't put very hot food into the refrigerator. Wait until steam has stopped rising from the food before putting it in the fridge.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h3>Avoid refreezing thawed food</h3>\n<p>Food poisoning bacteria can grow in frozen food while it is thawing, so avoid thawing frozen food in the temperature danger zone. Keep defrosted food in the fridge until it is ready to be cooked. If using a microwave oven to defrost food, cook it immediately after defrosting.</p>\n<p> As a general rule, avoid refreezing thawed food. Food that is frozen a second time is likely to have higher levels of food poisoning bacteria. The risk depends on the condition of the food when frozen, and how the food is handled between thawing and refreezing. Raw food should never be refrozen once thawed.</p>\n<h3>Store raw food separately from cooked food<h3>\n<p>Raw food and cooked food should be stored separately in the fridge. Bacteria from raw food can contaminate cold cooked food, and the bacteria can multiply to dangerous levels if the food is not cooked thoroughly again </p>\n<p>Always store raw food in sealed or covered containers at the bottom of the fridge. Keep raw foods below cooked foods, to avoid liquid such as meat juices dripping down and contaminating the cooked food.</p>\n<h3>Choose strong, non-toxic food storage containers<h3>\n<p>Make sure your food storage containers are clean and in good condition, and only use them for storing food. Cover them with tight-fitting lids, foil or plastic film to minimise potential contamination. Transfer the contents of opened cans into suitable containers.</p>\n<h3>If in doubt, throw it out!</h3>\n<p>Throw out high-risk food left in the temperature danger zone for more than 4 hours - don't put it in the fridge and don't keep it for later. Check the use-by dates on food products and discard out-of-date food. If you are uncertain of the use-by date, throw it out.</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"/9978e69bb7d5691a146ac55456728b83.pdf\">download Food Storage pdf</a>\n</p>\n</h3></h3></h3></h3></div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guidelines\">\n  <h2 id=\"food-cooling\">Cooling</h2>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"/3da001e15f8c6d48948b77b0046911fb.pdf\">download Food Cooling pdf</a>\n  </p>\n<p>Bacteria usually multiply faster at higher temperatures. The refrigerator should therefore be set to temperatures of no more than + 7 ° C and the freezer to -18 ° C to -20 ° C. The growth of germs is greatly reduced at refrigerator temperature, but there are also microorganisms that can multiply at these temperatures. </p>\n<p> Therefore:\n<ul> <li>Put the minced meat in a cool place immediately and process and cook through on the day of manufacture or purchase</li>\n\t <li>Fresh fish and fishery products must be stored at temperatures below + 2 ° C</li>\n\t<li> In order to maintain the viability of mussels and oysters, cooling at + 4 ° C to max. + 10 ° C</li>\n\t<li>Always defrost meat and poultry in the refrigerator or microwave</li>\n\t<li>Let the food cool down before putting it in the refrigerator. Portion larger quantities so that the cooling process is not too long.</li>\n\t <li>Only prepare meals that contain raw eggs (e.g. tiramisu) with very fresh eggs and then cool and consume immediately</li>\n\t <li>Freezing prevents or slows down the growth of microorganisms and thus extends the shelf life of the food. The killing or reducing of germs is usually not associated with deep freezing.</li>\n\t<li> Don't overfill your fridge.
